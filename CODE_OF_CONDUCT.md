# Witness & Archivista Community Code of Conduct

The Witness & Archivista community abides by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's
[code of conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
An excerpt follows:

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
> fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
> contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
> documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

Our community members represent the project and their fellow contributors.
We value our  community tremendously, and we'd like to keep cultivating a
friendly and collaborative environment for our contributors and users. We want
everyone in the community to have a positive experience.
